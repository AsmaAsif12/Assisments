Area of triangle is 17.5





# find area of square by using formula in python :

Formula : Area = side * side
def  area square ( side):
return side  * * 2
# Example
print ( area of square (5))
# Output : 25

Using user input

side = float ( input(Enter the side length of the square : " ))
area = side * * 2
print ( " Area of square :" , area)
# output : 25
